What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git files are added to keep track of the metadata (history and changes as you go about
your development)

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is the intermediate place before a commit is applied. it offers option to select the files to be commited
under a commit message that makes sense!
