When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when you're collaborating with a team!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
 Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You only want to pull changes that make sense, and that represent the functionality.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork: create a copy of a repo on github
clone: create a copy on your local computer
branches: just other types of commits on which you can build upon then merge later

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

keepig track of this state [origin/master] you can compare how far your local has changes since the last pull.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Harder, exchande code in txt files!
